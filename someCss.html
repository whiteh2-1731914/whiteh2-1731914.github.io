        <h3>Personal Expertise</h3>
        <p>From the twenty-one year's I have lived on this Earth, I have 
            always had a pet cat. It started out with an all black-colored 
            fur cat that my parents had named Midnight. Then came Tommy, 
            who was bought for my older sister when my younger brother was 
            born. Boots was the neect cat my family adopted, followed by 
            Panther. In more recent years, we adopted a kitten named Olive, 
            Coti, Nova, and the newest kitten's, Frankie and Lester in which 
            are still with us today.

        <h3>Personal References</h3>
        <p>I would like to introduce to you the beginning of a fun journey 
            to meet the cats the my family has adopted in the recent years! 
            We have Olive, who my brother decided to surprise my family with 
            after he had surgery to fix his torn ACL and LCL. She is the black 
            and white adult cat, and has what looks like white boots on. She is 
            a sassy girl who loves attention, but only for a certain amount of 
            time, when SHE wants to, and she can be a bit skiddish. Next, we 
            have Coti. She is the dark orange adult cat with the corkscrew 
            tail. She was adopted into our family by my older sister as well 
            as her husband. She is a bit timid, but loves her attention from 
            her mom and dad. Then we have Nova, the white-pawed, light and 
            dark-brown mix of colored fur male adolescent cat. He was brought 
            home as a surprise by my younger brother after his friend's adult 
            cat had a litter. He is energetic, loves the outdoors, and is the 
            most relaxed cat. The newest addition to our cat family is Frankie 
            and Lester, two kittens from the same litter. Frankie closley 
            resembles the look of Nova, while Lester is all black. Frankie is 
            a bit younger than Lester, and so far seems way more outgoing. 
            Lester seems to show a bit of anxiety when it comes to meeting newes
            people.
