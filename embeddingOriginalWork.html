       <h3>A Bit More About Me</h3>
       <p>My name is Hailey White. I am a senior at the University of Washington, working toward achieving my Bachelors degree in Psychology. This is my best effort at creating a website, and it has been so much fun! I have lived in the greater Seattle area my entire life, spending the majority of it in a town called Mountlake Terrace. I even graduated from Mountlake Terrace High School with an Honors STEM diploma.</p>
