       <h3>A Bit More About Me</h3>
       <p>My name is Hailey White. I am a senior at the University of Washington, working toward achieving my Bachelors degree in Psychology. This is my first time creating a website and I am having a blast. I grew up in the Greater Seattle Area my entire life, the majority of it centered in a town called Mountlake Terrace.</p>
