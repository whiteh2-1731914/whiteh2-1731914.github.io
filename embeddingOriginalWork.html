       <h3>A Bit More About Me</h3>
       <p>My name is Hailey White. I am a senior at the University of 
           Washington, working toward achieving my Bachelors degree in 
           Psychology. This is my best effort at creating a website, and 
           it has been so much fun! I have lived in the greater Seattle 
           area my entire life, spending the majority of it in a town called 
           Mountlake Terrace. I even graduated from Mountlake Terrace High 
           School with an Honors STEM diploma.</p>

        <h4>Family History</h4>
        <p>I have two older half-siblings, Alexa who is 26 years old and Nick 
            who is 23 years old, and one younger full-brother, Caden who is 18 
            years old. I grew up with them by my side and my mom Sarah and dad 
            Dennis. My parents now have a dog named Diesel. He is a Great 
            Pyrenees, which means he is about 120 lbs, so a very big boy.</p>

        <h3>Looking for a nice playlist to study to?</h3>
        <p>Here are my top 3 favorite playlists! They are not only great for 
            studying, but also go great as background music when you're doing 
            other things, like cleaning!</p>
