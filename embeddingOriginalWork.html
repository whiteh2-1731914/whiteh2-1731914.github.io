       <h3>A Bit More About Me</h3>
       <p>My name is Hailey White. I am a senior at the University of Washington, working toward achieving my Bachelors degree in Psychology. This is my best effort at creating a website, and it has been so much fun! I have lived in the greater Seattle area my entire life, spending the majority of it in a town called Mountlake Terrace. I even graduated from Mountlake Terrace High School with an Honors STEM diploma.</p>

        <h4>Family History</h4>
        <p>I have two older half-siblings, Alexa who is 26 years old and Nick who is 23 years old, and one younger full-brother, Caden who is 18 years old. I grew up with them by my side and my mom Sarah and dad Dennis. My parents now have a dog named Diesel. He is a Great Pyranese, which means he is about 120 lbs, so a very big boy.</p>
